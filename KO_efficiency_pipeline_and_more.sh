# Some important sources for knockout efficiency calculation:
# 1. https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/CrispRVariants/inst/doc/user_guide.pdf
# 2. https://cmdcolin.github.io/posts/2022-02-06-sv-sam

# Kasper's suggestion is that including supplementary alignments in coverage calculation, that is, do not get rid of them in coverage calculation and counting CRISPR-editing reads!
# reads with small indels larger than 4 or 5 bases should be counted to find CRISPR-editing reads because reads with small indels less than 4 or 5 bases might be sequencing errors!
# Keeping in mind that small indels less than 4 or 5 bases might be existed also because of CRISPR-editing so this pipeline does not yield 100% accurancy in KO efficiency calculation!
# Reads in target site either have small indels or large indels, that is, when a read has small indel it has no large indel, versa vica!

# To calculate knockout efficiency in ONT data

# --- Start

# 1. Go to target site which is 5bp up and downstream of gRNA coordinates and exclude supplementary reads which do not belong to target site of interest

# samtools mpileup --region chr9:44881220-44881249 --excl-flags 0x800 Ctr6_3_exon1.bam | cut -f 5 | tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]' | fold -w 1 | sort | uniq -c > Ctr6_3_target_site_mpileup.txt

# --region chr9:44881220-44881249 is 5bp up and downstream of gRNA location for Kmt2a exon1
# --excl-flags excludes reads with 0x800 flags which means supplementary reads
# In Ctr6_3_target_site_mpileup.txt output, number of $ and ^ characters gives us number of reads with large indels, whereas number of + and - characters gives us number of reads with small indels

# 2. Calculation of coverage in target site of interest. In this step, supplementary reads should be exluceded because those reads coming from second target site which is targeted by second gRNA!

# samtools coverage --region chr9:44881220-44881249 --ff 0x800 Ctr6_3_exon1.bam

# 3. Knockout efficiency calculation

sum of number of reads with large and small indels divide by total number of reads in target site (coverage)

# Note: * character in samtools mpileup output represents deletion of reference genome instead representing a deletion in reads. Therefore, in KO efficiency calculation, + and - characters should be used to count reads with small indels instead of * character.
# because * character is not representative for bases in reads, its representative for bases in reference genome
